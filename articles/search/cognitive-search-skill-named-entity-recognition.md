> [!NOTE]
> <ul>
> <li>
> Starting December 21, 2018, you will be able to associate a Cognitive Services resource with an Azure Search skillset. This will allow us to start charging for skillset execution. On this date, we will also begin charging for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage. Text extraction from documents will continue to be offered at no additional cost.
>
> The execution of built-in skills will be charged at the existing [Cognitive Services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/)
. Image extraction pricing will be charged at preview pricing, and is described on the [Azure Search pricing page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2042400). Learn [more](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md).</li>
> <li> Named entity recognition skill is considered "deprecated" and will not be officially supported starting Feburary 15, 2019. Follow recommendations listed in <a href="cognitive-search-skill-deprecated.md">Deprecated Cognitive Search Skills</a> page to migrate to a supported skill</li>

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.NamedEntityRecognitionSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured by `String.Length`. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phrase extractor, consider using the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).
