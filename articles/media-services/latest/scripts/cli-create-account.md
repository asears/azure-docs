# CLI example: Create an Azure Media Services account

The Azure CLI script in this topic shows how to create an Azure Media Services account. The Media Services account and the storage account associated with it have to be part of the same datacenter and the same resource group.

## Prerequisites 

Install and use the CLI locally, this article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version you have. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

Currently, not all [Media Services v3 CLI](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-cli-ref) commands work in the Azure Cloud Shell. It is recommended to use the CLI locally.

## Example script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../cli_scripts/media-services/media-services-create-account/Create-Account.sh "Create Account")]

## Clean up deployment

Run the following command to remove the
resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli
az group delete --name amsResourceGroup
```
