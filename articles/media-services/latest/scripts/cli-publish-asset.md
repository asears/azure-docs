# CLI example: Publish an asset

The Azure CLI script in this article shows how to create a Streaming Locator and get Streaming URLs back. 

## Prerequisites 

- Install and use the CLI locally, this article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version you have. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

    Currently, not all [Media Services v3 CLI](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-cli-ref) commands work in the Azure Cloud Shell. It is recommended to use the CLI locally.

- [Create a Media Services account](../create-account-cli-how-to.md).
