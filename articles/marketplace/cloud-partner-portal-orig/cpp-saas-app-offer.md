# Azure SaaS application offer

<table> <tr> <td>This section explains how to publish a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application to the Microsoft <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/">Azure Marketplace</a> or <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com">Microsoft AppSource</a>. Use SaaS applications when your solution will be deployed in your own Azure subscription and customers will log on through an interface you design and manage to test the application. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory">Azure Active Directory</a> (AAD) is used to leverage your existing trial environment. </td> <td><img src="./media/cloud-partner-portal-publish-web-app/saasapp-icon1.png"  alt="Azure SaaS application icon" /></td> </tr> </table>


## Publishing benefits

Some of the benefits of listing your applications on a Microsoft marketplace include:

- Reach 100 million Azure Active Directory users across Office 365 and     Dynamics 365.
- Extend your sales team: reach business users worldwide and gain a sales channel that engages end users, helps generate leads, and initiates conversations with new customers across industries.

- Get actionable insights: we will share insights into how your app is performing on AppSource, what works well, and how to further improve your sales procedures.


## Publishing process

To create and publish your app(s) on Microsoft Azure Marketplace or Microsoft AppSource, this section guides you though the following steps:

2.  Define your marketplace offer and plans.
3.  Provide marketing content and pricing.
4.  Test and certify your offer in the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com).
