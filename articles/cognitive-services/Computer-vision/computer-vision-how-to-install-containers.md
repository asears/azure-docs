# Install and run Recognize Text containers

Containerization is an approach to software distribution in which an application or service is packaged as a container image. The configuration and dependencies for the application or service are included in the container image. The container image can then be deployed on a container host with little or no modification. Containers are isolated from each other and the underlying operating system, with a smaller footprint than a virtual machine. Containers can be instantiated from container images for short-term tasks, and removed when no longer needed.

The Recognize Text portion of Computer Vision is also available as a Docker container. It allows you to detect and extract printed text from images of various objects with different surfaces and backgrounds, such as receipts, posters, and business cards.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Recognize Text container currently works only with English.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Preparation

You must meet the following prerequisites before using the Recognize Text container:

**Docker Engine**: You must have Docker Engine installed locally. Docker provides packages that configure the Docker environment on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms), and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/). On Windows, Docker must be configured to support Linux containers. Docker containers can also be deployed directly to [Azure Kubernetes Service](../../aks/index.yml), [Azure Container Instances](../../container-instances/index.yml), or to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster deployed to [Azure Stack](../../azure-stack/index.yml). For more information about deploying Kubernetes to Azure Stack, see [Deploy Kubernetes to Azure Stack](../../azure-stack/user/azure-stack-solution-template-kubernetes-deploy.md).

Docker must be configured to allow the containers to connect with and send billing data to Azure.

**Familiarity with Microsoft Container Registry and Docker**: You should have a basic understanding of both Microsoft Container Registry and Docker concepts, like registries, repositories, containers, and container images, as well as knowledge of basic `docker` commands.  

For a primer on Docker and container basics, see the [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/).

### Container requirements and recommendations

The Recognize Text container requires a minimum of 1 CPU core, at least 2.6 gigahertz (GHz) or faster, and 8 gigabytes (GB) of allocated memory, but we recommend at least 2 CPU cores and 8 GB of allocated memory.

## Request access to the private container registry

You must first complete and submit the [Cognitive Services Vision Containers Request form](https://aka.ms/VisionContainersPreview) to request access to the Recognize Text container. The form requests information about you, your company, and the user scenario for which you'll use the container. Once submitted, the Azure Cognitive Services team reviews the form to ensure that you meet the criteria for access to the private container registry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must use an email address associated with either a Microsoft Account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account in the form.

If your request is approved, you then receive an email with instructions describing how to obtain your credentials and access the private container registry.

## Create a Computer Vision resource on Azure

You must create a Computer Vision resource on Azure if you want to use the Recognize Text container. After you create the resource, you then use the subscription key and endpoint URL from the resource to instantiate the container. For more information about instantiating a container, see [Instantiate a container from a downloaded container image](#instantiate-a-container-from-a-downloaded-container-image).

Perform the following steps to create and retrieve information from an Azure resource:

1. Create an Azure resource in the Azure portal.  
   If you want to use the Recognize Text container, you must first create a corresponding Computer Vision resource in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create a Cognitive Services account in the Azure portal](../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md).

1. Get the endpoint URL and subscription key for the Azure resource.  
   Once the Azure resource is created, you must use the endpoint URL and subscription key from that resource to instantiate the corresponding Recognize Text container. You can copy the endpoint URL and subscription key from, respectively, the Quick Start and Keys pages of the Computer Vision resource on the Azure portal.

## Log in to the private container registry

There are several ways to authenticate with the private container registry for Cognitive Services Containers, but the recommended method from the command line is by using the [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

Use the [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) command, as shown in the following example, to log into `containerpreview.azurecr.io`, the private container registry for Cognitive Services Containers. Replace *\<username\>* with the user name and *\<password\>* with the password provided in the credentials you received from the Azure Cognitive Services team.

```docker
docker login containerpreview.azurecr.io -u <username> -p <password>
```

If you have secured your credentials in a text file, you can concatenate the contents of that text file, using the `cat` command, to the `docker login` command as shown in the following example. Replace *\<passwordFile\>* with the path and name of the text file containing the password and *\<username\>* with the user name provided in your credentials.

```docker
cat <passwordFile> | docker login containerpreview.azurecr.io -u <username> --password-stdin
```

## Download container images from the private container registry

The container image for the Recognize Text container is available from a private Docker container registry, named `containerpreview.azurecr.io`, in Azure Container Registry. The container image for the Recognize Text container must be downloaded from the repository to run the container locally.

Use the [docker pull](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) command to download a container image from the repository. For example, to download the latest Recognize Text container image from the repository, use the following command:

```Docker
docker pull containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-recognize-text:latest
```

For a full description of available tags for the Recognize Text container, see [Recognize Text](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2018655) on Docker Hub.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) command to list your downloaded container images. For example, the following command lists the ID, repository, and tag of each downloaded container image, formatted as a table:
>
>  ```Docker
>  docker images --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}"
>  ```
>

## Instantiate a container from a downloaded container image

Use the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command to instantiate a container from a downloaded container image. For example, the following command:

* Instantiates a container from the Recognize Text container image
* Allocates two CPU cores and 8 gigabytes (GB) of memory
* Exposes TCP port 5000 and allocates a pseudo-TTY for the container
* Automatically removes the container after it exits

```docker
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 8g --cpus 2 containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-recognize-text Eula=accept Billing=https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0 ApiKey=0123456789
```

Once instantiated, you can call operations from the container by using the container's host URI. For example, the following host URI represents the Recognize Text container that was instantiated in the previous example:

```http
http://localhost:5000/
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can access the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) (formerly the Swagger specification), describing the operations supported by a instantiated container, from the `/swagger` relative URI for that container. For example, the following URI provides access to the OpenAPI specification for the Recognize Text container that was instantiated in the previous example:
>
>  ```http
>  http://localhost:5000/swagger
>  ```

You can either [call the REST API operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/vision-api-how-to-topics/howtocallvisionapi) available from your container for asynchronously or synchronously recognizing text, or use the [Azure Cognitive Services Computer Vision SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.ComputerVision) client library to call those operations.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have Azure Cognitive Services Computer Vision SDK version 3.2.0 or later if you want to use the client library with your container.

### Asynchronous text recognition

You can use the `POST /vision/v2.0/recognizeText` and `GET /vision/v2.0/textOperations/*{id}*` operations in concert to asynchronously recognize printed text in an image, similar to how the Computer Vision service uses those corresponding REST operations. The Recognize Text container only recognizes printed text, not handwritten text, at this time, so the `mode` parameter normally specified for the Computer Vision service operation is ignored by the Recognize Text container.

### Synchronous text recognition

You can use the `POST /vision/v2.0/recognizeTextDirect` operation to synchronously recognize printed text in an image. Because this operation is synchronous, the request body for this operation is the same as that for the `POST /vision/v2.0/recognizeText` operation, but the response body for this operation is the same as that returned by the `GET /vision/v2.0/textOperations/*{id}*` operation.

### Billing

The Recognize Text container sends billing information to Azure, using a corresponding Computer Vision resource on your Azure account. The following options are used by the Recognize Text container for billing purposes:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ApiKey` | The API key of the Computer Vision resource used to track billing information.<br/>The value of this option must be set to an API key for the provisioned Computer Vision Azure resource specified in `Billing`. |
| `Billing` | The endpoint of the Computer Vision resource used to track billing  information.<br/>The value of this option must be set to the endpoint URI of a provisioned Computer Vision Azure resource.|
| `Eula` | Indicates that you've accepted the license for the container.<br/>The value of this option must be set to `accept`. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All three options must be specified with valid values, or the container won't start.

For more information about these options, see [Configure containers](computer-vision-resource-container-config.md).

## Summary

In this article, you learned concepts and workflow for downloading, installing, and running Computer Vision containers. In summary:

* Computer Vision provides one Linux containers for Docker, to detect and extract printed text.
* Container images are downloaded from a private container registry in Azure.
* Container images run in Docker.
* You can use either the REST API or SDK to call operations in Computer Vision containers by specifying the host URI of the container.
* You must specify billing information when instantiating a container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cognitive Services containers are not licensed to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate billing information with the metering service at all times. Cognitive Services containers do not send customer data (e.g., the image or text that is being analyzed) to Microsoft.
