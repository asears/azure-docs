# Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement offer

<table> <tr> <td>This section explains how to publish a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement solution to the Microsoft <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com">AppSource Marketplace</a>. All apps for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement (Sales, Service, Project Service, and Field Service) must go through our certification process and support a trial experience. The certification process checks your solution for best practices. The trial experience allows users to deploy your solution to a live Dynamics 365 environment. </td> <td><img src="./media/dynce-icon1.png"  alt="Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement icon" /></td> </tr> </table>
