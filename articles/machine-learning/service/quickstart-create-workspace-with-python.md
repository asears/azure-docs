# Quickstart: Use the Python SDK to get started with Azure Machine Learning

In this article, you use the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python to create and then use an Azure Machine Learning service [workspace](concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md). The workspace is the foundational block in the cloud that you use to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models with Machine Learning. 

You begin by configuring your own Python environment and Jupyter Notebook Server. To run it with no installation, see [Quickstart: Use the Azure portal to get started with Azure Machine Learning](quickstart-get-started.md).

In this article, you:
* Install the Python SDK.
* Create a workspace in your Azure subscription.
* Create a configuration file for that workspace to use later in other notebooks and scripts.
* Write code that logs values inside the workspace.
* View the logged values in your workspace.

You create a workspace and a configuration file to use as prerequisites to other Machine Learning tutorials and how-to articles. As with other Azure services, certain limits and quotas are associated with Machine Learning. [Learn about quotas and how to request more.](how-to-manage-quotas.md)

The following Azure resources are added automatically to your workspace when they're regionally available:
 
- [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/)
- [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/)
- [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/) 
- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/)

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning service](http://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.

## Install the SDK

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Skip this section if you use a data science virtual machine created after September 27, 2018.
> Data science virtual machines created after this date come with the Python SDK preinstalled.

The code in this article requires the Azure Machine Learning SDK version 1.0.2 or later.

Before you install the SDK, we recommend that you create an isolated Python environment. Although this article uses [Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html), you can also use full [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed or [Python virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

### Install Miniconda

[Download and install Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). Select Python 3.7 or later. Don't select the Python 2.x.

### Create an isolated Python environment 

1. Open a command-line window, and then create a new conda environment named *myenv* with Python 3.6.

    ```shell
    conda create -n myenv -y Python=3.6
    ```

1. Activate the environment.

    ```shell
    conda activate myenv
    ```

### Install the SDK

In the activated conda environment, install the SDK. This code installs the core components of the Machine Learning SDK. It also installs a Jupyter Notebook server in the conda environment. The installation takes a few minutes to finish based on the configuration of your machine.

```shell
# Install Jupyter
conda install nb_conda

# Install the base SDK and Jupyter Notebook
pip install azureml-sdk[notebooks]
```

You can use additional keywords to install other components of the SDK:

```shell
# Install the base SDK and auto ml components
pip install azureml-sdk[automl]

# Install the base SDK and the model explainability component
pip install azureml-sdk[explain]

# Install the base SDK and experimental components
pip install azureml-sdk[contrib]
```

In the Azure Databricks environment, use the [Databricks installation steps](how-to-configure-environment.md#azure-databricks
) instead.


## Create a workspace

1. To launch Jupyter Notebook, enter this command:

    ```shell
    jupyter notebook
    ```

1. In the browser window, create a new notebook by using the default `Python 3` kernel. 

1. To display the SDK version, enter and then execute the following Python code in a notebook cell:

   [!code-python[](~/aml-sdk-samples/ignore/doc-qa/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python/quickstart.py?name=import)]

1. Find a value for the `<azure-subscription-id>` parameter in the [subscriptions list in the Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade). Use any subscription in which your role is owner or contributor.

   ```python
   from azureml.core import Workspace
   ws = Workspace.create(name='myworkspace',
                         subscription_id='<azure-subscription-id>',	
                         resource_group='myresourcegroup',
                         create_resource_group=True,
                         location='eastus2' # Or other supported Azure region	
                        )
   ```

   When you execute the code, you might be prompted to sign into your Azure account. After you sign in, the authentication token is cached locally.

1. To view the workspace details, such as associated storage, container registry, and key vault, enter the following code:

    [!code-python[](~/aml-sdk-samples/ignore/doc-qa/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python/quickstart.py?name=getDetails)]


## Write a configuration file

Save the details of your workspace in a configuration file to the current directory. This file is called *aml_config\config.json*.  

The `write_config()` API call creates the configuration file in the current directory. The *config.json* file contains the following:

```json
{
    "subscription_id": "<azure-subscription-id>",
    "resource_group": "myresourcegroup",
    "workspace_name": "myworkspace"
}
```

This workspace configuration file makes it easy to load the same workspace later. You can load it with other notebooks and scripts in the same directory or a subdirectory. 

[!code-python[](~/aml-sdk-samples/ignore/doc-qa/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python/quickstart.py?name=writeConfig)]



## Use the workspace

Write some code that uses the basic APIs of the SDK to track experiment runs.

[!code-python[](~/aml-sdk-samples/ignore/doc-qa/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python/quickstart.py?name=useWs)]

## View logged results
When the run finishes, you can view the experiment run in the Azure portal. To print a URL that navigates to the results for the last run, use the following code:

```python
print(run.get_portal_url())
```

Use the link to view the logged values in the Azure portal in your browser.

## Clean up resources 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>You can use the resources you've created here as prerequisites to other Machine Learning tutorials and how-to articles.

If you don't plan to use the resources that you created in this article, delete them to avoid incurring any charges.

[!code-python[](~/aml-sdk-samples/ignore/doc-qa/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python/quickstart.py?name=delete)]

## Next steps

In this article, you created the resources you need to experiment with and deploy models. You ran code in a notebook, and you explored the run history for the code in your workspace in the cloud.

To use the code with the Machine Learning tutorials, you need a few more packages in your environment.

1. In your browser, close your notebook.
1. In the command-line window, select Ctrl+C to stop the Jupyter Notebook server.
1. Install the additional packages.  If you didn't install `azureml-sdk[automl]` above, make sure you do so now.

    ```shell
    conda install -y cython matplotlib scikit-learn pandas numpy
    pip install azureml-sdk[automl]
    ```

After you install these packages, continue with the tutorials to train and deploy a model.
