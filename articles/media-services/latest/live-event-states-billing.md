# LiveEvent states and billing

In Azure Media Services, a LiveEvent begins billing as soon as its state transitions to **Running**. To stop the LiveEvent from billing, you have to stop the LiveEvent.

When **LiveEventEncodingType** on your [LiveEvent](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/liveevents) is set to Standard, Media Services auto shuts off any LiveEvent that is still in the **Running** state 12 hours after the input feed is lost, and there are no **LiveOutput**s running. However, you will still be billed for the time the LiveEvent was in the **Running** state.

## States

The LiveEvent can be in one of the following states.

|State|Description|
|---|---|
|**Stopped**| This is the initial state of the LiveEvent after creation (unless autostart was set to true.) No billing occurs in this state. In this state, the LiveEvent properties can be updated but streaming is not allowed.|
|**Starting**| The LiveEvent is being started and resources are being allocated. No billing occurs in this state. Updates or streaming are not allowed during this state. If an error occurs, the LiveEvent returns to the Stopped state.|
|**Running**| The LiveEvent resources have been allocated, ingest and preview URLs have been generated, and it is capable of receiving live streams. At this point, billing is active. You must explicitly call Stop on the LiveEvent resource to halt further billing.|
|**Stopping**| The LiveEvent is being stopped and resources are being de-provisioned. No billing occurs in this transient state. Updates or streaming are not allowed during this state.|
|**Deleting**| The LiveEvent is being deleted. No billing occurs in this transient state. Updates or streaming are not allowed during this state.|
