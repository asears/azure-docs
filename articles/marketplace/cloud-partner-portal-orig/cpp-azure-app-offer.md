# Azure application offer

<table> <tr> <td>This section explains how to publish a new managed Azure application offer to the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/">Microsoft Azure Marketplace</a>.  Each managed application contains an Azure Resource Manager template that defines all the technical assets used by the application, which typically includes one or more virtual machines and other supporting Azure- or Web-based services. </td> <td><img src="./media/cloud-partner-portal-publish-managed-app/azureapp-icon1.png"  alt="Azure application icon" /></td> </tr> </table>
