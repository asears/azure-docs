# Connect to Azure Stack with PowerShell as an operator

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

You can configure the Azure Stack to use PowerShell to manage resources such as creating offers, plans, quotas, and alerts. This topic helps you configure the operator environment.

## Prerequisites

Run the following prerequisites either from the [development kit](./asdk/asdk-connect.md#connect-with-rdp) or from a Windows-based external client if you are [connected to the ASDK through VPN](./asdk/asdk-connect.md#connect-with-vpn). 

 - Install [Azure Stack-compatible Azure PowerShell modules](azure-stack-powershell-install.md).  
 - Download the [tools required to work with Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-download.md).  

## Connect with Azure AD

Configure the Azure Stack operator environment with PowerShell. Run one of the following scripts: Replace the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenantName and Azure Resource Manager endpoint values with your own environment configuration. <!-- GraphAudience endpoint -->

```PowerShell  
    # Register an Azure Resource Manager environment that targets your Azure Stack instance. Get your Azure Resource Manager endpoint value from your service provider.
Add-AzureRMEnvironment -Name "AzureStackAdmin" -ArmEndpoint "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external"

    # Set your tenant name
    $AuthEndpoint = (Get-AzureRmEnvironment -Name "AzureStackAdmin").ActiveDirectoryAuthority.TrimEnd('/')
    $AADTenantName = "<myDirectoryTenantName>.onmicrosoft.com"
    $TenantId = (invoke-restmethod "$($AuthEndpoint)/$($AADTenantName)/.well-known/openid-configuration").issuer.TrimEnd('/').Split('/')[-1]

    # After signing in to your environment, Azure Stack cmdlets
    # can be easily targeted at your Azure Stack instance.
    Add-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName "AzureStackAdmin" -TenantId $TenantId
```

## Connect with AD FS

Connect to the Azure Stack operator environment with PowerShell with Azure Active Directory Federated Services (Azure AD FS). For Azure Stack development kit, this Azure Resource Manager endpoint is set to `https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external`. To get the Azure Resource Manager endpoint for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.

<!-- GraphAudience endpoint -->

  ```PowerShell  
  # Register an Azure Resource Manager environment that targets your Azure Stack instance. Get your Azure Resource Manager endpoint value from your service provider.
  Add-AzureRMEnvironment -Name "AzureStackAdmin" -ArmEndpoint "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external"

  $AuthEndpoint = (Get-AzureRmEnvironment -Name "AzureStackAdmin").ActiveDirectoryAuthority.TrimEnd('/')
  $tenantId = (invoke-restmethod "$($AuthEndpoint)/.well-known/openid-configuration").issuer.TrimEnd('/').Split('/')[-1]

  # Sign in to your environment

  $cred = get-credential

  Login-AzureRmAccount `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackAdmin" `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -Credential $cred
  ```



## Test the connectivity

Now that you've got everything set-up, use PowerShell to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an application and add a virtual machine. Use the following command to create a resource group named **MyResourceGroup**.

```PowerShell  
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name "MyResourceGroup" -Location "Local"
```
